    SINGLE IMAGE MODE
        • figure out a way to handle 2 images of different sizes.
        • implement noise offset in both image modes so they wrap cleanly.
        • remove excess threshes for single image mode.
        • re-implement indexing for svg loading, so they are all placed in the list in order.
            • verify single.frag with grad.png
        • fix screen recording initialization issue.
            ( when the app in the background goes from white to not white, this is probably the loading screen being hidden )
            No idea why this is happening.
            Maybe the reason the svg icons are loading low res when we await updateSvgIcons() in startRecording() is because we are not waiting for the images to load inside updateSvgIcons().
